# 🌱 CO₂ Emissions Explorer – Visualizing the Carbon Story with Python

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions using Python and the [Our World in Data CO₂ dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data). Through visualizations and data exploration, we uncover historical trends, identify top emitters, and examine how emissions have changed over time — globally and per capita.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To break down and better understand how carbon emissions have evolved across countries and over decades — both per person and by emission sources like coal, oil, and gas.  
The goal is to turn raw CSVs into climate-conscious insights that are easy to interpret and share.
